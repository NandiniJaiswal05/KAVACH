KAVACH is a fully functioning IoT-based safety system designed to assist mountain climbers in managing health risks, weather conditions, navigation, and communication. It integrates hardware with AI and software to provide real-time updates, emergency communication, health risk prediction, and more. Developed by a team of first-time coders, KAVACH is an innovative project that uses smartwatch sensors, Bluetooth mesh networking, and a voice-based assistant to enhance climbers' safety. 

The system includes several key features, such as health risk prediction, where it monitors heart rate, SpO2, and other health metrics to predict potential health risks in high-altitude environments. It provides real-time weather updates and warnings based on location, helping climbers make informed decisions. The Bluetooth mesh network enables communication between co-climbers without relying on external cellular networks, ensuring connectivity even in remote areas. In case of emergencies, the system sends SOS alerts with GPS coordinates to rescuers, even in low-connectivity regions. Additionally, the system suggests optimal trails and alternative routes based on real-time location data. The voice-based assistant continuously provides hands-free updates on health status, location, weather, and more, allowing climbers to focus on their climb.

The installation process is simple, requiring a smartwatch with built-in sensors (heart rate, GPS, SpO2), a Raspberry Pi for processing and Bluetooth connectivity, and Bluetooth-enabled devices. After cloning the repository, users can navigate to the project directory, install the required dependencies, and connect their smartwatch to the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth to run the program.

KAVACH encourages open-source contributions. Anyone interested in improving the project can fork the repository, create a new branch, make their changes, and submit a pull request. This project is licensed under the MIT License, and special acknowledgments go to GitHub Education, Raspberry Pi, and smartwatch API documentation for supporting and enabling the integration of technologies that made KAVACH possible...
